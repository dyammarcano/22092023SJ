# Security Champion- Fundamentos: Threat Modeling Basics

## Foundational: Threat Modeling Basics 

### Question: In what tangible way does threat modeling benefit the customer?

* Threat modeling guarantees safety for the end user

* Companies that apply threat modeling reduce possible avenues of attack

* Customers receive guidance on how to safely use the application

* The use of threat modeling assists in the development of security audit procedures

### Answer

* Companies that apply threat modeling reduce possible avenues of attack

### Explanation

Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like "Where am I most vulnerable to attack?" and "What are the most relevant threats to prioritize?".

Threat modeling is a foundational element of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). The SDL Threat Modeling Tool is a core element of the SDL, and is used by Microsoft teams to perform threat modeling on high risk scenarios. The SDL Threat Modeling Tool is freely available to assist organizations in adopting Microsoft's SDL threat modeling process.

## Question: Identify the correct sequence of steps in the threat modeling process.

* Threat Identification > Design Change > Mitigation Evaluation

* Scope > Analyze > Mitigate > Test > Document

* Threat Identification > Design Change > Analysis > Documentation

* Scope > Draw > Analyze > Mitigate > Document

### Answer

* Scope > Draw > Analyze > Mitigate > Document

### Explanation

The threat modeling process consists of five steps:

- **Scope**: Define the scope of the threat model. This includes identifying the assets to be protected, the people who will use the assets, and the people who could be attackers.

- **Draw**: Create a diagram of the system that illustrates how the assets are accessed and protected. This diagram is called a Data Flow Diagram (DFD).

- **Analyze**: Identify and enumerate threats to the system. This includes identifying the attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.

- **Mitigate**: Identify and enumerate mitigations to the threats identified in the previous step. This includes identifying the most effective mitigations, and the mitigations that are most cost effective.

- **Document**: Document the threat model. This includes documenting the scope, the DFD, the threats, and the mitigations.

## Question: When should you do threat modeling?

* Just prior to release

* When you are forced to

* Early and often

* Once during the lifetime of the application

### Answer

* Early and often

### Explanation

Threat modeling should be done early and often. Threat modeling should be done early in the development process, and should be repeated as the application evolves. Threat modeling should be done often, as the application evolves, and as new threats are identified.

## Question: Threat modeling ensures that application security is built into the product _____.
